# Vr Game Project - Interstellar Vendetta

Developed By - Levente Kalman

## Game Idea

The idea for this game is that it is a futuristic setting where you wake up on a space ship with no memory of what happen. You are left alone, not knowing what lurks on the ship...

It is a first person shooter VR game where the player has to survive using the environment, weapons and ammunition they are able to find while avoiding enemies aboard the ship.

The goal of the game is to fight your way to the Hangar where you have to get on a ship and escape.
