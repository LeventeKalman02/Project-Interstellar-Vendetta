This is a Virtual Reality Game made in Unity for the final year project in BSC(Hons) in Software Development at ATU Galway.

## Game Idea
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6cebda1-f4e5-41f2-b530-11cc0ce215ae)

The idea for this game is that it is a futuristic setting where you wake up on a space ship with no memory of what happen. You are left alone, not knowing what lurks on the ship...
It is a first person shooter VR game where the player has to survive using the environment and the weapons and ammuntion they are able to find.

I am using a low poly world design from the Unity Store to create the world and the environment. 
The weapons that the player can use are also a pack from the Unity Store which is compatible and easy to use in VR development.

## Issues & Bugs Faced During Development
- Snapping of objects to the hand at the incorrect location on the object.
