This is a Virtual Reality Game made in Unity for the final year project in BSC(Hons) in Software Development at ATU Galway.

The name for the game is inspired by the setting. "Interstellar" invites the vastness and beauty of space to the mind, while "Vendetta" adds a personal touch and mystery to the title of the game.

## How to Play
**For this game you are required to own a Virtual Reality Headset.**

This game was tested and developed on the Oculus Quest 2 headset.

### Run the game

Navigate to the Build Folder.

Here you just need to run the Interstellar Vendetta.exe file.

### Win Condition

## Game Idea

The idea for this game is that it is a futuristic setting where you wake up on a space ship with no memory of what happen. You are left alone, not knowing what lurks on the ship...

It is a first person shooter VR game where the player has to survive using the environment, weapons and ammunition they are able to find while avoiding enemies aboard the ship.

The goal of the game is to fight your way to the Hangar where you have to get on a ship and escape.
